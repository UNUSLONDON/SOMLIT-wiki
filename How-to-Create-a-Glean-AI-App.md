# How to Create a Glean AI App

## Overview
Welcome to the future of work with Glean AI Apps! This guide will walk you through building your very own custom "Glean AI App" â€“ a smart assistant that uses your company's knowledge to help you get more done. Imagine an AI helper that can find information, answer questions, summarize documents, create content, and even take actions on your behalf, all without needing any programming skills.

By the end of this guide, you'll have built a fully functional Glean AI App tailored to a specific task, making your work life simpler and more productive.

## Prerequisites

### What You'll Need
- **A Glean Account:** You'll need access to Glean in your workplace.
- **Internet Access:** A stable connection to the internet.
- **Access to the Glean App Library:** Your Glean account needs to have the necessary permissions to create new AI apps. If you can't find the "New AI App" button mentioned below, contact your Glean administrator.

### Required Knowledge
- **What an AI Assistant Is:** (A computer program designed to help you by understanding your questions and providing information or performing tasks, much like a helpful human assistant.)
- **Basic understanding of your company's data:** (Knowing where important documents or information for your specific task are stored, like in Google Drive, SharePoint, GitHub, or Confluence.)

## Phase 1: Getting Started

### Step 1: Access the Glean App Library
First, you need to navigate to where you can create new AI apps within Glean.

**Action:** Go to your Glean homepage or dashboard. Look for a section or menu item labeled **"AI App Library"** or something similar.

**You should now see:** A collection of existing AI apps, or a blank page if no apps have been created yet.

### Step 2: Start a New AI App
Once in the library, you'll find the option to begin building your custom AI app.

**Action:** Click on the button labeled **"New AI App"**. It might be a prominent button, perhaps in the top corner or center of the page.

**Tip:** If you can't find this button, you might need to check your permissions or ask your Glean administrator for help.

## Phase 2: Defining Your AI App's Identity

### Step 3: Give Your App a Name and Description
This is where you give your AI app a clear identity so you and your teammates know what it does.

**Action:**
1.  **Name your app:** Type a clear, descriptive name in the "Name" field.
    *   *For our example, we'll name it:* **"Glean Eng Onboarding Buddy"**
2.  **Add a description:** In the "Description" field, briefly explain what your app is designed to do. This helps others understand its purpose.
    *   *For our example, the description will be:* **"Help Eng on board faster"**

**Tip:** Choose a name that clearly indicates the app's function. The description should be short and to the point.

## Phase 3: Connecting to Knowledge

### Step 4: Select Knowledge Sources
For your AI app to be truly useful, it needs access to the right information. This is where you tell it which company knowledge it should use.

**Action:**
1.  **Browse and select:** In the "Knowledge Sources" section, you'll see options to add different types of information.
    *   You can add **single documents** (like a specific PDF or Google Doc).
    *   You can add **containers** (like entire Google Drive folders, SharePoint sites, or Confluence spaces, which hold many documents).
    *   You can add **complete data sources and applications** (like your company's entire GitHub repository or your full Confluence instance).
2.  **Add relevant sources:** For our "Glean Eng Onboarding Buddy," we'll add sources that new engineers would need:
    *   **GitHub:** (Where the company's code lives.)
    *   **Confluence:** (Where a lot of engineering documentation is kept.)
    *   **Specific Onboarding Documents:** (Any documents specifically created for the engineering onboarding process at Glean.)

**Common Mistake:** Not adding enough relevant knowledge sources, which can make your app unable to answer questions correctly. Or, adding too many irrelevant sources, which can make it less focused.

**Important:** The app will only be able to access information that you have permission to view within these sources. This ensures data security.

## Phase 4: Teaching Your App How to Behave

### Step 5: Specify Instructions for Behavior
This is the "brain" of your AI app. Here, you tell it *how* to act, what personality to have, and what kind of responses to give.

**Action:**
1.  **Write clear instructions:** In the "Instructions" section, type out how you want your app to behave. Think of it like giving a job description to a new employee.
    *   *For our "Glean Eng Onboarding Buddy," we'll instruct it to:* "Act like a developer on the Glean engineering team, one that has been here since day one and is an expert in Glean's development practices."
2.  **Add specific guidance:** You can also tell it how to react to specific types of questions.
    *   *For our example, we might add:* "When I ask specific code or error-related questions, provide step-by-step debugging instructions and relevant code snippets from GitHub."

**Tip:** Be as specific as possible. The clearer your instructions, the better your app will understand and respond. You can tell it to adopt a specific role (like "expert," "mentor," "summarizer").

## Phase 5: Giving Your App the Power to Act

### Step 6: Configure Actions
Beyond just answering questions, Glean AI Apps can also *do things* for you by connecting to other tools. This is where you grant it the ability to take actions.

**Action:**
1.  **Add an action tool:** In the "Actions" section, you'll see options to add various "execution tools." These tools allow your app to perform tasks in other applications.
    *   *For our "Glean Eng Onboarding Buddy," we'll give it access to:* A **Jira execution tool**. This means your app can create Jira tickets on your behalf.
2.  **Select the necessary tools:** Choose any tools that fit the app's purpose.

**You should now see:** A list of available tools that your app can integrate with.

**Warning:** Only give your app access to tools it truly needs for its purpose, and ensure you understand what actions it can take with those tools.

## Phase 6: Launching Your App

### Step 7: Publish Your Glean AI App
You've built it, now it's time to share it! Publishing makes your app available for you and others to use.

**Action:**
1.  **Review settings:** Before publishing, quickly review all the settings you've configured.
2.  **Choose availability:** You'll likely have an option to decide who can use your app (e.g., just yourself, specific teams, or everyone in the company).
    *   *For our example, we'll make it available to:* **"all of my teammates"**.
3.  **Click "Publish":** Confirm your choices and publish your app.

**You should now see:** A confirmation message that your app has been created and published. It will now appear in your Glean AI App Library.

Congratulations! You've successfully built a Glean AI App in just a few minutes.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: I can't find the "New AI App" button.
**Solution:** This usually means you don't have the necessary permissions to create new AI apps. Contact your Glean administrator or IT support and request access. They can often grant you the right permissions quickly.

### Issue 2: My app isn't behaving as expected or giving relevant answers.
**Solution:**
-   **Review Knowledge Sources:** Go back to **Step 4** and double-check that you've included all the necessary documents, folders, and applications. If information is missing, the app won't be able to find it.
-   **Refine Instructions:** Revisit **Step 5**. Are your instructions clear and specific? Try rephrasing them, adding more detail about the role the app should play, or explicitly stating what kind of answers it should provide. Small changes here can make a big difference.
-   **Check Permissions:** Ensure the Glean app has the necessary permissions to *read* the data from the knowledge sources you've connected.

### Issue 3: My app isn't taking actions I expect, or the actions aren't working.
**Solution:**
-   **Verify Action Configuration:** Go back to **Step 6**. Make sure the correct "execution tools" are added and configured properly.
-   **Check Tool Permissions:** The app (and by extension, you, through the app) needs permission to perform actions in the connected tool (e.g., Glean needs permission to create Jira tickets on your behalf in Jira). If the action fails, it's often a permission issue with the connected tool.

## Summary
You've just learned how to build a powerful, custom Glean AI App with no coding required! You started by naming and describing your app, then connected it to your company's valuable knowledge. After that, you taught it how to behave through clear instructions and gave it the ability to take actions using integrated tools. Finally, you published your app, making it ready to boost productivity for yourself and your team.

Now that your app is live, try using it! Ask it questions, see how it responds, and test its ability to perform actions. Think about other tasks in your day-to-day work that could be made simpler with a dedicated AI assistant. The possibilities are endless!
